# GL4AngularExoDirective

Work on the Angular Assignment delivered by **Mohamed Taieb SLAMA** using Angular CLI V 10.2.0

## Assignment Description (Slide 88 of the main lecture)

This App's goal is creating a directive containing 2 HostBindings to change the style and 1 HostListener to listen the "keydown" event.
Running the app will give you an input area where by typing characters, both the input text color & the input border's color will randomly change to random colors.

## Development server & Running the App

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
